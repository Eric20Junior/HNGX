# Tools & Frameworks Used:
- Build: ReactJS
- CSS: TailwindCSS
- Hosting: Vercel

- Objective: Develop a proof-of-concept for an on-page assistant that appears in the lower left corner of a web page. This assistant should be a transparent, moving video (not an image) and provide helpful information to users.
# Requirements:
- Design and create an animated, transparent assistant that appears in the lower left corner of a web page.
- When a button is clicked on the page, the assistant should move to the button and explain what that button does.
- Implement a hover icon that, when pressed, allows the assistant to provide explanations for certain elements when users hover over them.
- For extra credit, add animations to make the assistant's movement to the button look natural and engaging.
- Explore the use of dynamic 3D effects for additional bonus points.
- Conduct research to find innovative techniques and technologies that can enhance the functionality and appearance of the assistant.
# Acceptance Criteria:
- The on-page assistant is integrated into the web page as a transparent, moving element.
- The assistant provides clear and helpful explanations when users click on buttons or hover over specific elements.
- When a button is clicked, the assistant smoothly moves to the button and delivers a concise explanation of its function.
- The hover icon is responsive and allows users to easily access explanations for relevant elements.
- Animations are implemented to enhance the assistant's movement to buttons and overall user experience.
- If dynamic 3D effects are attempted, they are well-executed and enhance the assistant's presentation.
- The assistant's appearance and behavior are in accordance with the provided design specifications.
- Users find the assistant's interactions intuitive and helpful.
- Any technical challenges or limitations are documented, and alternative solutions are explored as part of the research effort.
- The on-page assistant project is presented as a proof-of-concept with room for potential future enhancements based on user feedback.
